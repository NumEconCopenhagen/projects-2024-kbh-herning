# Inaugural project

# In this assignment we will code and show results from an exchange economy with two consumers A and B. We will solve and show different allocations for A and B which maximizes their utility, and leaves them atleast as well off, as they were with their initial endowments. We will use grid searches and solvers to find optimal allocations, and loop through different prices and initial endowments to find said allocations. We will plot the various allocations in the edge worth box provided in the assignment to illustrate and discuss the differences. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
