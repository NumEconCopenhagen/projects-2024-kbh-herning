# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solving a Principal Agent model for Insurance** 

In this project we will attempt to solve a principal agent problem for insurance. 

In the principal agent problem we have a principal(insurance company) who offers an insurance contract to the agent(consumer). The principal will want to maximize his expected profit, however he also has to take into consideration, that it needs to be beneficial for the agent to accept the contract. 

We will setup and solve the model analytically and numerically. We will also extend the model to include selvrisk for the agent, and see how this changes the outcome of the maximization problem. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
